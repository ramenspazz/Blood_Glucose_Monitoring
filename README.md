# Blood_Glucose_Monitoring
A program written in rust to do some stats on blood glucose data.

Currently outputs a graph of each day of data collected in its on data track plotted along side all other data tracks, listed in time from 0 to 24 hours.

I am currently working on; A least squares regression model to try and fit and predict values of blood glucose concentration measured in mg/dL with time for
data trend analysis and predicting future values within a given confidence interval; A model to tell the basal rate and other key metrics from data.
